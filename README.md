# CineNest

CineNest is a personalized streaming platform that allows users to watch movies and series in a lightweight, user-friendly environment. This project was inspired by a desire to create an alternative to platforms like Netflix that operate primarily as a front-end and back-end service provider with high costs. CineNest is designed to be simpler, more cost-effective, and a streamlined solution for entertainment.

## Why CineNest?

I wanted to create a site similar to Netflix but less expensive. Platforms like Netflix operate by sourcing content from other providers and offering a nice front-end and back-end system. CineNest aims to achieve a comparable experience while being accessible and affordable, focusing on streaming simplicity and user satisfaction.

## Languages and Skills Learned

During the creation of this project, I explored and learned various technologies and skills:
1. **HTML**: For structuring the web pages and laying the foundation of the site.
2. **CSS**: To style the site, making it visually appealing and responsive for both desktop and mobile users.
3. **JavaScript**: To add functionality like dynamic video playback and modal windows for better user interaction.
4. **Git and GitHub**: To manage code versioning and host the site online.
5. **Project Structuring**: Organizing files like videos, images, scripts, and stylesheets effectively.

## **How I Progressed**

1. **Basic HTML Setup**: Our computer sir had encouraged us to build a website.
2. **Idea Formation**: I had read some books like (responsive web using HTML5).
3. **Styling with CSS**: styling was done with external css format because inline,internal css is not best and it helps you organize code nicely.
4. **Functionality with JavaScript**: So first of all i did not know a thing about javascript i used various websites and tools to learn and copied some from chatgpt.
5. **Hosting**: I learned how to deploy the site on GitHub Pages to make it accessible online.
6. **Refinements**: I continuously improved the design, added features like a microphone section, and optimized the user experience.
